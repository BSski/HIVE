<b><h1 align="center">HIVE</h1></b>
<h2 align="center">(work in progress)<br>Â </h2>

Platform created to facilitate conducting spatial multi-agent iterated prisoner's dilemma experiments between groups controlled by artificial neural networks. Built using deep reinforcement learning algorithm - DDDQN (Double Dueling Deep Q-Network).

Based on <a href="https://github.com/wau/keras-rl2">keras-rl2</a>.
Simultaneous agent inspired by <a href="https://github.com/velochy/rl-bargaining/blob/master/interleaved.py">interleaved.py by Velochy</a>.
Most of the code was written in 2020. I have learned a lot since then and I am aware of the quality of it.

<h2>:chart_with_upwards_trend: Changelog:</h2>

:date: 01.02.2021
- no GUI version for faster experiments

:date: 03.01.2021
- board's nature is hexagonal now instead of rectangular
- added optional controllable debug agent

:date: 23.12.2020
- the program is running in cycles now, X simulations in a row
- added appending data to .csv files after each simulation

:date: 10.12.2020
- using DQN instead of DDPG (DDPG couldn't handle TFT)
- UI changes

:date: 03.12.2020
- using DDPG instead of DQN now
- agents have parameters that impact their actions

:date: 21.11.2020
- agents now exist on 2d 43x43 plane and interact when on the same tile
- added visualisation done in pygame

:date: 04.11.2020
- more than two players can play now (interleaved training)
- added 7 NPCs with popular PD strategies
- players now include current episode step and type of the enemy in their observations

:date: 28.10.2020
- created stable, developable version of two neural nets playing PD against each other using:
  - custom OpenAI gym
  - custom keras-rl2 agent
  - custom keras-rl2 callbacks

:date: 21.09.2020
- created OpenAI custom gym environment
- connected it to keras-rl2, doesn't work yet, need to create a proper network for it

:date: 16.09.2020
- created the repository
- added prisoner's dilemma basic mechanism
